        text:"I love these prenatals so much! The daily doses make it easy to remember and not forget something, as often happened when I was taking most of the supplements individually before. I've also noticed that I sleep better when I take the prenatal, and very quickly notice that it's harder for me to sleep if I forget to take it. After taking a ton of supplements for IVF, the easy packaging, having everything in one place has been easier and more cost-effective for me!",

I find I'm so much better at remembering to take my supplements than with multiple bottles in my cupboards or even with those daily/weekly pill boxes that are a pain to open and refill each week.",
